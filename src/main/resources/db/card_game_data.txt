123symptom123
This week you're going to take a good hard look at your sleeping patterns and suss out how they're formed by what you do during the day. Your day and nighttime activity and how they work together is known as your sleep/wake cycle, and this cycle is kept in order by what you've probably heard called - your body clock.

Many factors affect your body clock's function, such as what time you go to sleep, what time you wake up, how many hours you sleep, how much light or darkness enters the eyes, and how active you are during the day. 

If you get all these conditions right and working together, your body clock starts to reset and your whole system ends up in better shape. The quality of your sleep improves. How you feel during the day improves. You have more physical energy, more mental alertness, and an increased ability to handle what the day throws at you. 

Your challenge is to start resetting your body clock. 
123intro123
Choose a time to wake up tomorrow. A good time for your body clock's function is 7 AM. Set your alarm on repeat for whatever time you choose.
Inconsistent sleep puts stress on your body clock's function, on your brain's function, and in the end, on the way you function. 
For the first few days your body will tell you it doesn't want to wake, as it'll still be stuck in its old ways, but as the week goes on you'll start to notice the difference.  
123mission123
Good job!  For the remaining missions of this card, your main mission will be to wake up at the same time you set yourself in the first mission.  As a side mission, find a way to expose yourself to a natural source when you wake up in the morning (open the blinds, go into the backyard). 
123mission123
Your side mission for today is to create a list of things you do when you feel tired during the day to pep yourself up. Don't forget your main mission.
123mission123
Figure out at what time you need to fall asleep in order to get your 8 hours. 
123mission123
For the remainder of the week, go to sleep and get out of bed at this newly set time each day.

There's been a great improvement in the quality of your sleep, which means your body clock is resetting! Awesome.

The more you keep at this new cycle, the more it will become so second nature that you won't have to think about it anymore. The right chemicals will be released at the right times, giving energy when you want it, and readying you for rest when you need it. You'll be more alert and more focused.

There's been some improvement in the quality of your sleep, and with a bit more work you'll really master your body clock. Sometimes it takes more than a week to see it reset,  so with that in mind move on to Body Clocking Part 2 to optimise these skills, and see the More Info section for tips on how to improve.

Just because you haven't reset your body clock this week doesn't mean you can't. Some people's body clocks just take longer to reset. Move on to Body Clocking Part 2 for more on how to reset your body clock, and see the More Info section for tips on how to improve.

Body Clocking Part 2 - Get Moving

123symptom123
In order to get the most out of this Mission, it's recommended you first complete Body Clocking Part 1.

This week you're going to spend some time getting your body in the best possible condition for quality sleep. A great way to do this is to get moving during the day. And the best way to get moving is through a little aerobic exercise. 

Regular aerobic exercise increases blood flow to your muscles, your lungs, and your brain, ridding the body of chemicals that cause stress and tension, and putting your system in prime position for staying alert during the day and for quality sleep at night. 

Whether it's a little low-impact exercise such as walking around the block, or higher-impact exercise such as running or swimming, getting moving is the smart way to fine tune you body clock's function. 
123intro123
Similar to Body Clocking Part 1, plan to go to sleep and wake up at the same time each night for the week but also schedule your aerobic exercise for each morning. 
Remember, stick to a level of exercise with which you're comfortable. The key is to start slowly, and not overdo it. If you're regularly active then try some higher-impact exercise but if you're not then a walk is fine!
Start with exercising for just 5 minutes. If you can do more, that's even better.  
123mission123
If you're not used to exercising, the first few days are going to be a little tough. If initially you're finding it too tough, start with a shorter session, and then as the week progresses, gradually lengthen the time. 
Beginning tomorrow increase your exercise time by 5 minutes every day. 30 to 45 minutes per session is ideal and is what we're shooting for by the end of the week.   
123mission123
You could also find it hard to muster the motivation to start exercising, but it's guaranteed at the end of every session you'll feel the difference. The goal is not to wear yourself out to the pain or breathlessness, but to get your body moving until you're buzzing. By the end of the week you'll start to see why regular exercise is the way to go.
If you're not exercising at the ideal 45 min mark, increase your exercise time by 5 minutes.
123mission123
While 30 to 45 minutes per session is ideal, even if you only get moving for 15 minutes at a time, it's important you get moving every day of this week.
For the remainder of this week, keep exercising and building towards 30 to 45 minutes exercise time.    
123mission123

Your results show that getting moving has lifted your mood, raised your energy levels, and improved the quality of your sleep. Well done!

It takes time to get used to aerobic exercise, and no matter your result, it's important to make it a part of every week. After a few weeks of incorporating it into your life, you'll be stronger, have more energy, and soon wonder how you ever slept without it.

This week, enjoyment is the focus. People often say that anything rewarding needs hard work. Not true. Sometimes the things you enjoy can help you just as much to achieve your goals, and making time for them is important in leading a balanced life. 

Work, study and chores. They're always going to be there, so it's important to break them up with stress-free stuff. Whether it's listening to music, playing an instrument, watching your favourite movie, playing the Xbox, mucking around on the net, or whatever else you enjoy; making time for these activities - knowing at that time you're not meant to be doing anything else - is a great way to take the pressure down.

If you've felt pretty crappy lately, and are in a low mood most of the time, enjoyable stuff is a great reminder of the fact that you can feel better. When you experience the good stuff more often, your brain starts to crave it, and you start to find ways to take that feeling into other areas of  your life.

Genuine enjoyment helps the brain produce tension-relieving chemicals and can make the harder parts of the day that much easier to tackle. 
123intro123
Write a list of activities that usually make you feel good. See if you can come up with around 6 for each. 
123mission123
Timetable everything that's happening over the coming week, and make some time to do one of these activities each day.
123mission123
Set a reminder in your phone for each activity.
123mission123
Sometimes it can be just as difficult to get the motivation to do the things you enjoy as it is to do the things you don't. It's important to just start doing it, because as soon as you do, you'll notice how calming it can be. Remember, there's no need to feel guilty, as at these scheduled times, you're meant to be enjoying yourself!
For the remainder of the week, stick to your timetable and enjoy the activities you've chosen!    
123mission123
Positive Change
Your results show that taking time to enjoy yourself has had a positive effect on your stress levels. Good Stuff.

123symptom123
This week is all about hanging out. You're going to put aside a bit of time each day to hang out with someone and switch off from the daily grind.

Spending time with others directly affects how clear you're seeing things. When you spend too much time with your own thoughts they stay stuck in your head and can seem a little more full on than they really are. A bit of time with someone you like lightens your mood, gives you perspective, and a break from your own head. 

There's an old saying that goes: No man is an island. It's a fancy way of saying that no one can rely only on themselves when leading a balanced life. 
123intro123
Off the top of your head, make a list of the people you like hanging out with. Once you've named all ones you can think of, go through your phone, your emails and your Facebook friends just in case you've forgotten anyone. Add them to the list. 
123mission123
Dust off the Playstation, pump up the soccer ball, start making those phone calls and plan the next week.
123mission123
Stick to your schedule and just have fun. At the end of each day, note down why you like hanging out with that person and decide when you'd like to see them next. 
123mission123
Taking some time to talk about nothing with a mate is a great way of alleviating stress. Remember you're not pressured to talk about anything in particular, and there's no agenda to the meet, it's just a time for you to enjoy someone else's company.

Food As Fuel

123symptom123
This is a food-focused week. 

Food is fuel, and fuelling your body with the right food is important. Say your car takes unleaded petrol, and you decided to fill it with diesel. When you take off down the road, you'll soon figure out that the car won't get very far. 

The same goes with your body. If you're not eating foods that help your system run as designed, your body and mind slow and all sorts of health problems arise. 

Your challenge is to try a week of running your system on the best possible fuel, and to note the difference it has on your energy and stress levels. 
123intro123
Look up a list of healthy foods on the internet. From the list of foods you've never tried, choose one and look up a recipe for it on the net (you can do this by searching for the main ingredient + recipe). Find a recipe you like the look of and think you could do.  Make preparations necessary to cook that meal.
123mission123
Your mission for today is to cook that meal. 
Try noting how you feel an hour after you've eaten different foods e.g. do you feel sick, tired, hyper or focused, energised and calm
123mission123
Find another recipe that appeals to you and prepare it for tomorrow. Don't skip any meals - especially breakfast (even if its small)
123mission123
Today, try to incorporate as many of the foods you ticked into your diet. 
For the remainder of the week, try to find a new recipe and cook it.  If you can't, cook one of the meals you made earlier in the week. 
Healthy, natural foods are what your body and mind need. The occasional cheeseburger is fine, but when you eat unhealthy foods, your body has trouble knowing what to do with them; they fail to break down properly for digestion and can cause to all sorts of health problems. 
123mission123

Your Mission was to fuel your system with the right foods, and you've noticed how helpful this can be. Great!

Your life is made up of different networks of people and those networks all add something different to your life. The purpose or value of these networks can also change over time.

Family networks start by providing you what you need for survival, food, shelter, education etc but this changes as you get older and gain more independence. Your network of school friends often start off as no more than playground entertainment but as things start getting serious they may be people you can draw on for your education, even if its just copying their maths homework..

Knowing your different networks and what value they add to your life will help you identify what networks are the best to draw on for different problems at different times.  
123intro123
Go through your phone and think about into which network each of the names would fit (some may be in more than one). 
When you come across a name that does not fit into any of the existing networks, create a new one and name it.
123mission123
Today you will pick a network and observe your networks and the value they add to your life. Write one of the these values under each of the networks heading on a sheet.
123mission123
For the remainder of the week, your mission will be same as the last. Pick a new network for each day and observe the value they bring to your life.  If you have gone through them all, cycle through again.

We all have strengths and weaknesses in different areas. You could be the best basketball player alive but could scare a dog if you ever picked up a trumpet. You could organise a great party but could suck at pouring drinks. So this week, forget about being good at everything and focus on the fact that everyone is good at something. 

Whether it's climbing trees, nailing guitar solos, telling random jokes, guessing the endings of movies, doing sums in your head, cooking a mean pasta, finding quicker shortcuts while driving, troubleshooting faulty Internet connections, or any other thing you're good at, figuring them out is a great way to give you some direction. 

When you know where your strengths lie, you know which areas of life deserve your time, and are that much closer to realising your potential.
123intro123
Your mission today is to think about how many things do you think you are good at? On a sheet of paper, write down a list of everything you're good at. Big or small. Count how many you've listed and note the total down in the box at the bottom.

123symptom123
Fatigue is a feeling that you're chronically tired - mentally and physically.
It can be caused by a number of factors, including unhealthy lifestyle choices, workplace problems and stress.
123intro123
Your doctor will evaluate your condition and order tests, as necessary. "If you suffer from chronic fatigue, the first step is to see a doctor to rule out a treatable medical problem such as anemia," advises Elizabeth Araujo, MD, a rheumatologist at the University of Cincinnati. "If you have a chronic condition like fibromyalgia or rheumatoid arthritis, work with your doctor to make sure your disease is being treated and controlled properly." Get the appropriate blood work and make sure you are not having any reaction to a medication.
123mission123
Eat regularly throughout the day. Food boosts your metabolism and gives your body energy to burn. A nutritious diet can help energize you throughout the day. A diet high in fruit, vegetables, and grains is best, with moderation in other food groups including dairy, meat, and oils.
123mission123
Drink lots of water. A dehydrated body functions less efficiently.
123mission123
Get enough sleep. Adults need about 8 hours per night. For tonight, set your alarm so you get the required amount of sleep. Fatigue can be one of the most difficult aspects of living with a chronic illness. "Sleep that is deep and restorative and in the range of seven to eight hours a night is ideal to help replenish important neurochemicals like natural endorphins [pain modulators] and serotonins. Sleep also allows joints and muscle to heal and rest.
123mission123
Today, try to incorporate at least 30 min of exercise in your day.  Regular exercise not only boosts your energy, it makes it easier for you to fall asleep at night. "Engage in daily low-level exercise, such as gentle stretching and walking. Exercise will help with stress and improve sleep, as well as help maintain strength, balance, and flexibility," says Dr. Rosian. The best time to exercise to fight fatigue is early in the day. Avoid exercising in the evening because the stimulation of exercise can interfere with sleep.
123mission123
Today's you will try relaxation training. Constant anxiety drains the body of energy and can lead to burnout. Relaxation techniques, such as meditation and yoga, help to 'switch off' adrenaline and allow your body and mind to recover.
123mission123
Over the course of the week, you have experimented with several techniques to reduce tiredness.  Write down which ones you felt were beneficial and repeat them for the remainder of the week.
123mission123
If you have a debilitating disease like rheumatoid arthritis or chronic fatigue syndrome, or if you have just been pushing yourself too hard, you need to accept feeling a certain amount of fatigue. Getting frustrated and angry about being tired only worsens fatigue. Consider making accommodations in your work schedule, or at least counter some of the time spent at work with activities that bring you joy and satisfaction — compromise and balance are necessary. "People who stick to a sensible schedule and a regular regimen do better at fighting fatigue in the long run," says Rosian.

123symptom123
This week your going to learn how to de-stress using the most basic skill you have - breathing.

When you're stressed your heart rate increases and your breathing becomes shallow and rapid. This is fine if your stressed out about catching a kangaroo but if your stressed about something that doesn't involve running then this response is not so helpful.

Everybody can relate to the tightness in your chest and thumping heart before doing something your nervous about like public speaking, meeting new people or exams. 

What you might not notice is the slighter, yet just as useless and distracting, breathing patterns and heart rate you have when your stressed about the smaller things like getting to school on time, finishing the homework assignment etc.

This week your going to learn to recognise when your stressed and how to distress by developing your optimal breathing and heart rate. 
Not only will this help you keep calm and conquer those really stressful situations but make you feel less stressed in your day to day life.
123intro123

b) Breath in and then out, counting how long it takes each way.
c) On the next breath, breath in for 5 seconds and out for 5 seconds. Do this for 10 breaths.
d) For 10 more breaths, breath in for 7 seconds and out for 7 seconds.
5. Measure your pulse rate. It should be lower as the exercise has starting bringing your breathing and heart rate to its optimal level.
123mission123
Over the next week try to notice when you're feeling stressed using the signs you listed on your sheet. When you notice your stressed, try breathing in for 5 seconds and out for 5 seconds for just 3 breaths.
At the end of each day, no matter how stressed you feel, do the breathing exercises. Like any kind of skill, practice makes perfect so doing the slow breathing when your not stressed will mean your primed for those pressure situations.

123symptom123
People are made up of patterns. The more you do something in a certain way, the more it becomes part of a pattern, to the point where it's so second nature that you don't even notice you're doing it anymore. 

If you've spent enough time thinking negative thoughts about yourself, you probably won't even realise you're thinking them or how much they're bringing your mood down, no matter how disruptive or untrue they may be. 

In three parts, the Pattern Maker will help you identify these negative thoughts and find ways to replace them with new, positive thoughts, to the point where you're forming new, positive patterns. And as these patterns form, your stress levels will drop, your positivity will increase, and your mood will lighten.  

Technically speaking, the Pattern Making process is called Cognitive Restructuring. It's a method of slowing the cogs in your brain that have been wrongly turning for too long, then helping them turn the other way.
123intro123
